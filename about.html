        <p>
          I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building
          thoughtful, efficient, and user-focused technology. I enjoy turning
          ideas into real, working solutions, whether that's a small script that
          automates a task or a full-scale application that solves a real-world
          problem.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I'm especially interested in how software can simplify complexity and
          create meaningful impact. I love diving into challenging problems,
          learning new technologies, and continuously improving my skills.
          Curiosity drives me, I'm always exploring better ways to write clean,
          maintainable code and design systems that scale.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Beyond coding, I value clear communication, and lifelong learning. I
          believe the best products are built at the intersection of strong
          technical foundations and human-centered thinking.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          My goal is to grow as a software engineer who not only writes great
          code, but also contributes positively to teams, users, and the broader
          tech community.
